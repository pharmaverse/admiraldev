#  Dear Developers

`{admiraldev}` is a set of tools intended for you, the developer, to help make developing within the admiral family easier, consistently robust across all packages and maybe even fun! 

Tools are loosely defined as follows:

* Utility Functions used in `{admiral}` and `{admiral}` extension functions for doing custom checks and providing custom messages, warnings and errors.  These custom messages, warnings and errors are succinct, but helpful messaging around what a function expects as inputs. The inputs to admiral functions are many, but generally fit into three categories: datasets, variables and arguments. Most of the functions start with `assert_`, `is_` or `get_`.

* Addins and utility functions that help with documentation, testing and checking on health of the code base in all admiral packages.

* Vignettes on working on `{admiral}` functions, developing unit testing, releases process, vignette writing and other documentation needs.  These vignettes are intended for use across all admiral packages.

# Why have a separate development package?

As the `{admiral}` package function base has grown it was decided to create extension packages for use within companies and specific TAs to help with specific problems. We intended these extension packages to follow the same processes as `{admiral}` core, e.g. Unit Testing, Roxygen Documentation, Function Design. A standalone development package allows us to keep an up to date development process for all developers across the family.  We also feel that a lot of the developer functions are not user-specific and gives us more freedom to create and release utility tools specific to our family of packages and reduces non-user facing functions within the admiral family of packages.

# How to add new tools to `{admiraldev}`?

* Just like in `{admiral}`, we follow the same procedures of adding issues to discuss feature requests, bugs and documentation updates.  We then develop those issues in branches and do a Pull Request with a Code Review.  

* Experimental tools are highly encouraged to help reduce repetitive patterns and automating the boring stuff.  

# When to add a function to `{admiraldev}`?

## **Scenario One: {admiral} core** 

A developer working on `{admiral}` core implements a new type of derivation function for a BDS-Findings ADaM dataset. The new derivation function has two new `assert` custom checking functions for inputs as well as a helper function.

Loose guidelines:

1. The derivation function should always live in `{admiral}` core.
1. The helper function should be looked at to see it should be made available within `{admiraldev}` for other extension packages needs and so reduce repetitive coding across the family of `{admiral}`. If it cannot be generalized, then it should remain in `{admiral}`.
1. The `assert` custom checking functions should always live within `{admiraldev}` to stay with the family of `assertion` functions.

## **Scenario Two: {admiral} extension** 

A developer working on `{admiralonco}` implements a new type of derivation function for adding certain parameters to an oncology specific ADaM dataset. The new derivation function has one new `assert` custom checking function. 

Loose guidelines:

1. The derivation function should be closely looked at to see if it can be generalized to other ADaM datsets.  If that is the case, then it should be moved to `{admiral}` core. If the function is very specific to oncology needs, then it should remain in `{admiralonco}`.
1. The `assert` custom checking functions follow a similar principle - if they can be generalized to other therapeutic areas then move to `{admiraldev}`, whereas if very specific to oncology needs, then they should remain in `{admiralonco}`.
