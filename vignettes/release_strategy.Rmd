# Introduction

This article explains how we do package releases for `{admiral}` and across all our
package extensions. This includes details around planned/scheduled releases, as well
as hotfixes.

# Release Schedule

A release schedule is maintained on the [homepage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/#release-schedule).

# Planning Releases

In the past, whenever we started looking towards a future release, we would create 
a new release issue label on GitHub of the form `release Q4-2022` and **prioritize** 
these issues. However, as our backlog is minimal every issue should be considered 
a Priority Issue.  If an issue is not a Priority, then it should be sent back to 
a Discussion Tab and formed into a Priority issue.

We should share in advance with our users a high level summary of expected package
updates via the community meetings, especially any anticipated breaking changes.

# Package Release Process

In the following the most important steps for a planned release and a hot fix
release are described. Depending on the package it may be helpful to use
`usethis::use_release_issue()` with a package-specific `release_bullets()`
function.

## Planned Release

A package release is done in the following steps:

1) Create the release version:
    a) Create a new feature branch from `main`.
    a) Call `usethis::use_version()` to update the `Versions:` field in the
    `DESCRIPTION` file and update `NEWS.md` (replace "(development version)"
    with the version to be released)
    a) Create a PR into `main` and merge it. The title of the PR must contain "[skip vbump]".
    Otherwise, the vbump workflow sets the version to a development version and
    CRAN will reject the submission.
1) Bundle up from `main` (`devtools::build(manual = TRUE)`) and send off to
CRAN. See the [chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#decide-the-release-type)
in R Packages for more details.
1) If CRAN asks for modifications, repeat steps 1-2 as necessary.
1) Once the package is accepted and available on CRAN, use the release button on
GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub, select the `main` branch as target,
and use a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`, e.g., `v1.1.2` (see past [admiral
releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference and
[Releasing to Github](release_strategy.html#releasing-to-github) section for
more details).

    This releases onto Github archives the version of code within the `main` branch,
attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file and
makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from
[insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).

    It also builds the website for the released version and stores it in a new
`vx.y.z` folder on the `gh-pages` branch.

1) Merge `main` into `patch` to be prepared in case of a needed hotfix.
1) Create the next development version:
    a) Create a new feature branch from `main`.
    a) Call `usethis::use_dev_version()` to update `NEWS.md` (adds a new
    section `# admiral (development version)`) and update the version in the
    `DESCRIPTION` file to a development version.
    a) Create a PR into `main` and merge it.
    
## Hot Fix Release

Rarely, we may need to release a hot fix to immediately address a bug. In the
majority of cases, an off-cycle release can be made directly from the `main`
branch, where bug fixes and new features would be released earlier than planned,
thus avoiding the `patch` branch release.

A hot fix release is done in the following steps:

1) Identify all the bugs that need to be fixed for this hot fix release and
label them with the "hotfix" label.
1) Branches addressing the bugs should have Pull Requests merged into a single
`patch` branch **NOT** the `main` branch, where the `patch` branch has been
created from the most recent release of the package. To do this, run the following git commands:

`git checkout -b patch vX.Y.Z`

`git push -u origin patch`

There is no need to use
development versions. I.e., the first pull request should set the version in
`DESCRIPTION` to the version to be released and a corresponding heading should
be added to `NEWS.md`.

1) When naming the branch follow the [naming conventions](git_usage.html#implementing-an-issue) guide.

1) If all PRs for the hot fix are merged (to `patch`), bundle up from `patch`
(`devtools::build(manual = TRUE)`) and send off to CRAN. See the
[chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#decide-the-release-type) in R Packages
for more details.

1) If CRAN asks for modifications, repeat steps 1-4 as necessary.

1) Once the package is accepted and available on CRAN, , use the release button

on GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub, select the `patch` branch as
target, and use a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`, e.g., `v1.1.2` (see past [admiral
releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference and
[Releasing to Github](release_strategy.html#releasing-to-github) section for
more details).

    This releases onto Github archives the version of code within the `patch`
branch, attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file
and makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from
[insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).

    It also builds the website for the released version and stores it in a new
`vx.y.z` folder on the `gh-pages` branch.

1) These hot fixes should then be merged into the `main` branch through an
additional Pull Request. Merging the PR will update the version in the
`DESCRIPTION` file to a development version.
1) Create the next development version:
    a) Create a new feature branch from `main`.
    a) Update `NEWS.md` (add a new section `# admiral (development version)`)
    a) Create a PR into `main` and merge it.

# Releasing to Github
Under the [Releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) section in the main repo, select `Draft a New Release`. Proceed by creating the appropriate release tag and header, denoted as `vX.X.X` and `admiral X.X.X` respectively, for the release:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43018762/228875673-5b6daa64-1909-47c9-bd61-69b810c2f742.png)

Copy the contents of the `NEWS.md` section for the release, paste it into the release notes section:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43018762/228875743-d17729fe-9b38-432a-9bb0-5fdc157ec231.png)

Then in the upload box where it says, "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them" upload the appropriate `admiral_X.X.X.tar.gz` file available for download at the  [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/admiral/index.html). Click `Publish Release` and you're all done!

**NB:** Occasionally, you might need to delete the tag when something is done in error.  Deleting a tag can not be done on GitHub and must be done in the terminal.  However, it is very easy!!  Just use:

`git push --delete origin tagname`

# Communications

After the release, we raise awareness via our Slack channel and LinkedIn.
