Otherwise, feel derivation rule unique need sufficiently complex justify opt dedicated function specific variable/parameter (e.g. treatment-emergent flag AEs). certain variables closely connected (e.g. imputed date corresponding imputation flag) single function provide variables. something needed ADaM achieved simply via existing tidyverse function, wrap admiral function, add unnecessary extra layer users. following principles key designing new function: Modularity - code follows modular approach, .e. steps must clearly separated dedicated purpose. applies scripts creating dataset module create single variable parameter. also complex derivations several steps. Commenting steps key readability. Avoid Copy Paste - similar code used multiple times, put separate function. improves readability maintainability makes unit testing easier. done every simple programming step tidyverse can used. rather computational functions data checks. However, also consider nest many functions. Checks - Whenever function fails, meaningful error message must provided clear reference input caused failure. users dig detailed code want apply function. meaningful error message supports usability. Flexibility - Functions flexible possible long reduce usability. example: source variables newly created variables conditions selecting observations hard-coded. useful argument triggers optional steps, e.g. filter argument specified, input dataset restricted, otherwise step skipped.
