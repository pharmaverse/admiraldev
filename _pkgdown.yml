  desc: |
    Functions and arguments may need to be removed or replaced over time.
    In such cases, the function or argument will enter a 3 year deprecation cycle.
    The cycle will be tied as close as sensibly possible to a package release.

    When a function is deprecated:

    * In Year 1 there will be a message issued if you use the function/argument, but it will still be available to use.
    * In Year 2 a warning will be produced if you use the function/argument, but it will still be available to use.
    * In Year 3, an error will be produced if you use the function/argument and no longer be able to use.
    * Finally, after 3 years, the function/argument and related documentation and tests will be removed from `{admiral}`.

    *Note: Guidance on replacement functionality will be found in the message produced as well as in the function's
    documentation*

    Below, you can find a list of functions in the process of being deprecated:
